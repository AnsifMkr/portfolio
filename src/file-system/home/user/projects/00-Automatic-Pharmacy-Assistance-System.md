This project is primarily designed to assist elderly individuals who suffer from diabetes and often have to endure long waiting times in queues at pharmacies. The main objective of this project is to automate and streamline the process of dispensing medicines, thereby reducing the time and effort required for patients to collect their prescribed medications.

The solution works as follows: When a doctor prescribes medicines for a patient, the prescription data is directly transmitted to the pharmacist. This enables the pharmacist to prepare and dispense the required medicines in advance. As a result, once the patient has completed their consultation with the doctor, they can directly collect their pre-dispensed medications from the pharmacy without unnecessary delays.

By implementing this system, the project aims to enhance convenience, improve efficiency in pharmacies, and reduce the burden on elderly patients who might otherwise struggle with long waiting times.

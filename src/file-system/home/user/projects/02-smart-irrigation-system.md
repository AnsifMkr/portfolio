## 2022-23

### â€¢ Arduino Code
This project addresses the issue of uneven water distribution in plantations, where some plants receive more water while others do not get enough. During the summer season, watering needs to be done twice a day to maintain optimal soil moisture levels.

To ensure efficient water usage, we use a hydrostatic pressure level sensor to monitor the water level in the well. If the water level falls below a certain threshold, the system will prevent irrigation. The sensor's output is fed into a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560) to control the system's operation.

Additionally, soil moisture sensors are placed for each plant to determine whether the soil is wet or dry. A threshold value is set to decide if watering is required. If the soil is dry, the system automatically irrigates the plants.

The entire system is fully automated to operate twice a day. To further enhance its functionality, a DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC) module is integrated, allowing scheduled irrigation at specific times.This smart irrigation system ensures optimal water usage, prevents overwatering or underwatering, and helps maintain plant health efficiently.
